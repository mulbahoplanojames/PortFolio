Learn the building blocks of web pages! This easy-to-follow guide explains common HTML tags and how to use them. Think of it as your handy cheat sheet for creating your own web content. I will break down each tag in simple terms, so you can start building web pages even if you're completely new to coding.

### What are HTML Tags?

HTML tags are like secret codes that tell your web browser what to do. They help make words bold or italic, add pictures, or create lists. Every webpage uses these tags in its HTML, which is just a fancy way of saying "the language websites use." Think of HTML as the recipe that tells your browser how to cook up a webpage!

### Examples Of HTML Tags

- `paragraph Tag`: The `<p>`and `</p>` are called HTML tags. The text you put between them is known as a "Paragraph Tag." These tags help format the text as a regular paragraph on your webpage. Using them makes your text easier to read and keeps your content organized. You can use these tags as many times as needed to create multiple paragraph

- `Heading Tags`: The `<h1>` and `</h1>` are called HTML tags. The text you put between them is known as a `Heading Tag.` These tags format the text as a Heading 2, which is a type of subheading on your webpage. Headings help break up your content, making it easier to read. You can use different heading tags `(<h1>, <h2>, etc.)` to create a clear structure in your content.,

- `Bold Tag`: The `<b>` and `</b>` are called HTML tags. The text you put between them is known as a `Bold Tag.` These tags make the text appear bold on your webpage. Bold text is great for highlighting important words or phrases. You can use this tag whenever you want to make something stand out.

- `Italic Tag`: The <i> and </i> are called HTML tags. The text you put between them is known as an `Italic Tag.` These tags make the text appear italic on your webpage. Italic text is useful for emphasizing words or phrases. You can use this tag whenever you want to add a subtle emphasis to your content.

- `underline Tag`: The `<u>` and `</u>` are called HTML tags. The text you put between them is known as an `Underline Tag.` These tags make the text appear underlined on your webpage. Underlined text can help draw attention to specific words or phrases. Use this tag when you want to highlight something important.

- `Break Tag`: The `<br/>` is an HTML tag known as the `Break Tag.` It doesn't wrap around any text like other tags do. Instead, it creates a line break, moving the text that follows to a new line. This tag is useful when you want to add space between lines or separate content without starting a new paragraph. You can use it whenever you need to control the layout of your text.

- `Horizontal Rule Tag`: The `<hr/>` is an HTML tag called the `Horizontal Rule Tag.` It creates a horizontal line across the page, separating sections of content. This tag helps visually divide different parts of your webpage. You can use it to make your content look organized and easier to read.

- `Image Tag`: The `<img>` is an HTML tag used to add images to your webpage. You place the URL of the image inside the tag to show it on the page. This tag helps you include pictures, graphics, or icons. You can use it to make your content more visually appealing and engaging.

This tag makes it easy to display information in a structured format, like schedules or comparisons. You can use it to present data clearly and make your content more organized.

### How Do Web Pages Read HTML Tags?

Servers read HTML code to understand and display content. They process the HTML from top to bottom, just like you read this guide. You can use as many or as few tags as you want to format your content. However, there are some essential HTML tags and rules that you need to follow

An opening tag — this will start with a `<>`; symbol. Content — the short instructions on how to display the on-page
element; and a closing tag — this will end with a `</>`.

However, some HTML tags can be unclosed. That means that the HTML tag does not need to be closed with a &lt;/&gt;. You’ll typically
use unclosed tags for metadata or line breaks.

### What’s the Difference Between Attributes and HTML Tags?

- HTML tags contain instructions on how to display an on-page element. They begin with a &lt; and end with a &gt; and precede
  and follow the content of the element. (e.g: `<>` Bold Tag `</>`)

- HTML Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and appear at within the HTML tag (e.g. `<`html lang="en-US"`/>`).
